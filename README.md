# Indonesian SMS Spam Detector
Indonesian SMS Spam Detector is a natural language processing application that was built in Python and implemented to GUI using Python Tkinter. This model is intended to classify a SMS as either it is spam or ham. This model performs data preprocessing to 'clean' the data, extract the feature, perform classification using TF-IDF Vectorizer, and implement it to GUI using Python Tkinter. This project is created as a final project in the Natural Language Processing course.
